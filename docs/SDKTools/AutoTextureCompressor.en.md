# Auto Texture Compressor

## Overview

Auto Texture Compressor is a tool used to compress in-world textures.

## Preparation

1. To use this tool, you need to install the following external tools:

    - [PVRTexTool](https://developer.imaginationtech.com/pvrtextool/){target=_blank}
    - [Textconv](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex){target=_blank}

    After installation, ensure that the folder containing `PVRTexTool\CLI\Windows_x86_64\PVRTexToolCLI.exe` is added to your system PATH. (The steps for this are omitted here.)

2. From the menu bar, select **Vket Cloud SDK -> Build And Run** to generate textures within the world that will be compressed under the release folder in advance.

## Usage

By configuring the settings as shown in the function description image and starting the tool, the following processes occur:

1. A `.bat` file for compressing `World.heo` is launched

2. The `HEOTexComp` tool operates on `World.heo`

3. A `.bat` file for compressing `World (1).heo` is launched

4. The `HEOTexComp` tool operates on `World (1).heo`

5. `HEOSameTexOptimizer` starts, consolidates the compression results into a folder named `Scene1`, and copies it to `release/data/Field`

6. A `.bat` file for compressing `World (2).heo` is launched

7. The `HEOTexComp` tool operates on `World (2).heo`

## Notes

### About Auto Add Fields

When the "Remove Existing Fields" checkbox is unchecked, "Auto Add Fields" will add only new files that are not already included, and without duplication.

Auto Add Fields will be done in the following cases even when the "Proceed" button is not pressed:

- When the window is opened

- When the scene hierarchy is updated

### Notes on Auto Texture Compressor

- If no actual heo files are selected, the Start button will be disabled and cannot be pressed. Please ensure at least one file is selected.
