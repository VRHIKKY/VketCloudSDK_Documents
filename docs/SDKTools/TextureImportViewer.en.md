# Texture Import Viewer

![TextureImportViewer_1](img/TextureImportViewer_1.jpg)

## Overview

Texture Import Viewer is a SDK Tool dedicated to view the project's texture import settings and compressed size as a list.

On the Viewer, the texture can be sorted by size, name, etc., which import settings can be edited / exported by once.<br>
This allows the texture settings to be reformatted at once, which can either be saved or exported/replaced by same procedure as [Export Compressed Texture](./ExportCompressedTexture.md).

Therefore, this tool is handy when multiple texture files needs reformatting.

## How to Use

![TextureImportViewer_2](img/TextureImportViewer_2.jpg)

On the Unity Menu, select Vket Cloud SDK > Tools > TextureImportViewer to open the Viewer's window.

![TextureImportViewer_3](img/TextureImportViewer_3.jpg)

The Viewer is displayed above on opening the window.

By setting the search options below and pressing "Update Texture List", the textures in Scene/Project will be shown in a list.

### Search Options

| Label | Initial Value | Function |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Ignored Folders (Size / Element)| 1, Assets/IgnoredFolderName | Designates a folder by name to be excluded on updating the texture list.<br>By increasing Size, the number of folders to be excluded can be increased. |
| Find scene textures only | true | Enables/Disables search mode to only include the textures used in the current scene.<br>If the checkbox is empty, all textures in the Assets folder will be counted(which may lead to longer update time)|
| Show Optional Info | true | Enable/Disable display of texture details (Compression, Compressor Quality, Compressed Size(KB), Compressed Pixel) |
| Load raw pixel (increases search time) | false | Loads raw pixel size of the texture before compression (caution: may lead to longer search time) |
| Is NPOT only | false | Enable/Disable search only for pre-compressed texture in NPOT format.<br> This can be enabled only when `Load raw pixel` is true.|

By enabling `Load raw pixel`, the texture's original pixel size can be displayed. However, as this leads to longer load time, handle with caution when loading textures outside the Scene as well.

### Viewer Maneuvers

![TextureImportViewer_4](img/TextureImportViewer_4.jpg)

By selecting each texture on the Viewer, the selected texture is selected in Assets and displayed on the Inspector.<br>
Multiple selection can be done by selecting files while holding Shift or Ctrl key.

![TextureImportViewer_5](img/TextureImportViewer_5.jpg)

By selecting categories in the texture list header, the textures can be sorted in ascending/descending order.

![TextureImportViewer_6](img/TextureImportViewer_6.jpg)

By editing Texture Type ~ Use Crunch Compression settings and selecting "Apply", the settings of each texture can be saved at once.<br>
Also, selecting "Compress Selected" on selected textures or selecting "Compress All", the texture files can be exported/replaced as the same method of [Export Compressed Texture](./ExportCompressedTexture.md).
