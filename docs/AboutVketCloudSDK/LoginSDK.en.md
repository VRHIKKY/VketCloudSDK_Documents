!!! warning "Note to macOS users"
    If you are using a macOS environment having Safari, Unity 2019, Unity 2022, or Unity 6 installed, this may cause an issue disabling login to Vket Cloud SDK. <br>
    In such case, please uninstall Unity 2022, 2019, or Unity 6 that you are not using for your current Vket Cloud SDK project from the Unity Hub, restart the OS, and retry login.<br>
    Please note that we have confirmed a bug where login may fail if you are using the Apple Silicon version of Unity. In that case, please try switching to the Intel version of Unity.
