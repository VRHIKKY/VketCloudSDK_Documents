# Overview and Setup

GUITools is a derivative tool outside of Vket Cloud SDK designed to edit and save the Activity Canvas GUI for VKC Item Activities in worlds created in Vket Cloud. The tools are primarily divided into GUI Importer and GUI Exporter, and the json files saved by the edits made in GUITools are referenced at the time of world loading. If a new UI is added, it needs to be defined by HeliScript. For more details, see [Advanced Implementation](AdvancedUse.md) and [Built-in Functions - GUI](../hs/hs_system_function_gui.md).

## A. Preparation

As preparation, set up the Unity project and install the Vket Cloud SDK according to the procedures in [How to Install Vket Cloud SDK](../AboutVketCloudSDK/SetupSDK_external.md).

!!! caution "Points to Note When Setting Up the Environment"

    - Use the 3D template
