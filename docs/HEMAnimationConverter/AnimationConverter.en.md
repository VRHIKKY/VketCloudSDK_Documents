# How to Use HEM Animation Converter

In Vket Cloud, the type of animation must be Legacy in Unity.<br>
Normally, the conversion from Humanoid to Legacy animation in Unity can only be done on the same character model due to differences in bone names and the structure. <br>
HEM Animation Converter can convert the Humanoid animation of a certain character to a Legacy animation for the targeted character model.

## How to start HEM Animation Converter

Select [Tools] --> [HEMAnimationConverter] from [Vket Cloud SDK] tab.
