# Control Statement

Describes control constructs such as conditional branching and repetition.

## if - conditional branch

Conditional branching can be realized by dividing the processing with *{}* after `if (conditional expression)`.

```
int x = 100;
int y = 200;

if (x == y) {
     // what to do if x == y evaluates to true
} else {
     // What to do if x == y evaluates to false
}
```

## while - repeat

By writing `while (conditional expression) { }`, you can write a process that repeatedly executes *{}* until the conditional expression becomes *false*.

Use *break* to force exit from the loop.

```
int x = 0;
while (x < 100) {
     // repeat this process while x is less than 100
     ++x;
}

int y = 0;
// Since the conditional expression is always true, repeat the processing until you explicitly exit with break
while (true) {
     if (y >= 100) {
         // force exit from loop
         break;
     }
     ++y;
}
```

## for - iteration with initialization and iterators

By writing `for (initialization; conditional expression; iterator) { }`, the following process will occur.

1. Initialize variable,
2. If the result of evaluating the conditional expression is *true*, execute the processing within *{}*.
3. After processing the iterator,
4. Check the conditional expression again, and if it is *true*, return to 2. and repeat the process

Conditional branching is achieved by containing the processing statements in *{}*.

```
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
     // repeat this process 100 times
     hsSystemOutput("%d\n" %i);
}
```

## Exiting Loops (break, continue)

Using *break* or *continue*, you can control execution of loop process.

### break

*break* allows you to exit the loop in the middle of its execution.

```csharp

int i = 0;
// This loop will continue indefinitely since the condition is always true, unless explicitly exited with break.
while (true) {
    if (i >= 100) {
        // Forcefully exit the loop with break.
        break;
    }
    ++i;
}

```

### continue

*continue* allows you to skip the remaining loop process and move on to the next iteration.

```csharp

// This loop displays the value of i 100 times.
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
    if (i == 5) {
        // However, when i equals 5, continue skips the rest of the loop, so nothing is displayed.
        continue;
    }
    hsSystemWriteLine("i=%d" % i);
}

```

## switch - Concise description of many branch conditions

```
switch (value used for condition judgment) {
     case judgment_value_A:
         // Process A
         break;
     case judgment_value_B:
         // process B
         break;
     // ...
}
```

You can concisely write multiple conditional expressions and the processing to be executed when true for one value.

By putting a *default* clause at the end of a *case*, you can write the processing statements when none of the *cases* are met.

```
int id = 100;
string message;

switch (id) {
     case -1:
         message = "dummy account";
         break;
     case 0:
         message = "root user";
         break;
     default:
         message = "restricted user";
         break;
}
```

??? warning "In functions with a return value, you must return outside the scope of the switch statement"
    ```
    string GetStatus(int status){
        switch (status)
        {
            case 0:
                return "off";
            default:
                return "on";
        }
        return "on"; // This statement is required even if there is a default clause
    }
    ```

??? warning "Constants from other classes cannot be used as branch conditions"
    Constants defined in the global scope or within the same class can be used.
    ```
    const int GlobalConstant = 0;

    class ClassConstant
    {
        public const int Value = 1;
    }

    class NewComponent
    {
        const int MyConstant = 2;

        public NewComponent()
        {
            int id = 2;
            ClassConstant OtherClassConstant = new ClassConstant();

            switch (id)
            {
                case GlobalConstant: // OK
                    break;
                case OtherClassConstant.Value: //NG: Compilation error will occur
                    break;
                case MyConstant: // OK
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

## { } - Block-Based Scope
Within a method, *{ }* can be used to define scope.

```
public void example() {
    int x = 10;
    { 
        int y = 20;
    }

    // -> "x:10"
    hsSystemOutput("x: %d" % x);

    // Error because y is out of scope
    hsSystemOutput("y: %d" % y); 
}
```
