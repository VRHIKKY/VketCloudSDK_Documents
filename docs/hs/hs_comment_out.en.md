# HeliScript - Commenting

HeliScript supports two types of comments. Single-line comments start with `//` and end at the end of the same line. Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. The following code shows examples of both:

``` csharp
// This is a single-line comment.

/* This comment can be used to describe
   the entire class.
   You can write multiple paragraphs or even add links
*/
```

Single-line comments can also be written after executable code on the same line. The comment will continue to the end of the line.

``` csharp
return test++; // Increment the test.
```
