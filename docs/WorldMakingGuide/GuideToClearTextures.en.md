Since Vket Cloud SDK13.1, a function has been added to automatically convert non-png textures to png. However, please prepare a png file in advance because textures may be blurred when using this function.

### Advanced/Non-Power of 2
With NPOT textures, this option is available, as are various algorithms such as ToNearest and ToLarger. However, NPOT textures are always blurred or missing dots. Therefore, you should prepare a POT texture.

### Advanced/Read/Write Enabled
Vket Cloud SDK needs to be checked for Read processing in various places.

### FilterMode
Select Point; Vket Cloud SDK uses this algorithm to scale the texture.

### Compression
Set to None. Doing so may cause blurring of colors.

### Use Crunch Compression
Do not check the box.
