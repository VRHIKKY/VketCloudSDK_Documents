# File Deployment Config

## Overview

When building or uploading a world, the world creator may include a designated file within the world data for various purposes.<br>
This feature is designed for including a file on deploy without altering the scene settings.<br>
For example, when a world is loaded on the browser, this configuration can be dynamically edited using HeliScript to operate scripts and data context.

The included files and folders will be deployed under release/data/.

When committing `Build And Run`,  the included files and folders will be deployed under `release/data/`.
When committing `Upload to Remote Server`, the included files and folders will be deployed under `upload/data/`.

1. By running `Build And Run` or uploading the world, the designated files will be included on build.

!!! note "Alternative method to generate FileDeploymentConfig"
    When generating a FileDeploymentConfig file on step 1, the same file may be generated by pressing the `Create File Deployment Config` button on [BasicSettings](../VketCloudSettings/BasicSettings.md).<br> This will save a `FileDeploymentConfig.asset` in the Assets folder.
