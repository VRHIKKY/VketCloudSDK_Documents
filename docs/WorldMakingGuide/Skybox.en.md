# Setting up a Skybox

![Skybox_1](img/Skybox_1.jpg)

Vket Cloud SDK cannot handle a Unity Skybox. Therefore, a Box or Sphere object with a reversed normal can be used as a pseudo-Skybox instead.

While an object with reversed normal is usually created by using Blender and other 3D modeling software, the SDK has a Skybox object in its tutorial scene, which can be used in your creation by placing the object / replacing texture in your project.

## How to setup a background

!!! note "Adding Skybox and Background Texture using Quick Menu"
    On Ver12.3, a new quick menu feature has been added, which includes easier Skybox and Background Texture setup. <br>
    For details, refer to [Quick Menu for adding Vket Cloud objects](../WorldEditingTips/QuickMenu.md).

1. Select the tutorial scene (Basic) in the Vket Cloud SDK menu > Tutorials > Tutorial -Basic-, which will download the tutorial scene data and related assets.

2. The Skybox object used in the tutorial scene is located in "Assets > Samples > Vket Cloud SDK > [Current_SDK_Version] > Tutorial -basic- > Used Files > Models".
    Select the "Sky_Sphere" object in the "Models" folder and drag & drop to place it in your scene.

3. The scale of the Sky_Sphere can be edited in the Inspector. Also, the texture can be replaced by your own by editing the Skybox material located in the Inspector.

## Tips

By selecting "Unlit/Texture" for the material shader, the Skybox object will be displayed without shadows.

!!! note "about VKC Item Background Texture"
    As an alternative method to setup a background, there is [VKC Item Background Texture](../VKCComponents/VKCItemBackgroundTexture.md), which displays the same image from any camera angle and is particularly useful when creating backgrounds for 2D games and similar applications.
