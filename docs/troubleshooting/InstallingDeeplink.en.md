# SDK does not appear after install

If the Vket Cloud SDK does not boot after installing / show up on the tabs, there is high chance that the Deeplink package failed to be imported automatically.<br>
In such cases, the issue may be solved by manually importing the Deeplink package.

## "Vket Cloud SDK" Tab Not Appearing

Sometimes, the "Vket Cloud SDK" menu does not appear at the top of the Unity interface. Below are two common reasons why this might happen.

### Set the Api Compatibility Level to .NET 4.x

Check if the Api Compatibility Level in the Player settings (Project Settings → Player → Configuration) is not set to .NET 4.x. Update it to .NET 4.x.

If the tab still does not appear, try restarting Unity and then check the error console.

### Presence of VRChat-Related Assets

Conflicts often occur if Udon scripts, VRM conversion scripts, or UniGLTF scripts are present. Coexistence with VketCloud can be difficult. The quickest solution is to remove all script files (.cs). Keep in mind that when importing assets from VRC, scripts cannot be used with VketCloud.
