## Unresolved Issues
- When updating from the external version of SDK 14.2.1 to SDK 14.4.12 using the Install Wizard, the loading animation may not complete.
  - Force-restarting Unity allows the update to proceed without issue.
- In SDK 14.4.12, `Tutorial-Visual` is temporarily unavailable due to maintenance.
  - To use Visual features, please reuse content created in versions 14.2.1 or 13.7.7.
- [Windows & Mac] `VKCNodeActionTrigger`, `VKC Item Activity`, `VKC Setting Nameplate`, and `VKCSetting Spawn` display improperly when carried over from 13.7.7 to 14.4.12.
  - This issue is caused by a serialization problem with Unity's `Reorderable List`, requiring manual adjustments during migration.
- `VKC Item Text Plane` displays inconsistently between in-game builds and Unity's Play Mode.
  - The in-game build display is correct; use `Build And Run` to verify text display.
- [Mac Only] Icons displayed in the hierarchy may not update immediately.
  - Use `VketCloudSDK > Tools > Debug Console` to refresh and resolve the issue.
- `VKC Attribute Clickable UI` finger icons overlap with Gizmos icons by default.
  - Disabling Gizmos in Unity Editor reveals the finger icons.
- The emote function displayed at the bottom-right of the game window in Play Mode does not work.
  - Use `Build And Run` to verify emote functionality.

# Version 14.4.0

## HeliodorLib (Engine used in browser-displayed worlds)

### Feature Additions and Adjustments
- Omitted the functionality to display multiple general-purpose dialogs
    - This is a temporary measure due to fundamental design issues that prevented opening general-purpose dialogs in HeliScript outside of Canvas

### HeliScript
- Aligned the behavior of LayerBundle and Layer's SetShow() with hsCanvasSetLayerShow()
