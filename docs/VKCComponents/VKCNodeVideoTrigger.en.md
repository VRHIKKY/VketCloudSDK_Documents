![HEOVideoTrigger_1](img/HEOVideoTrigger_1.jpg)

VKC Node Video Trigger is used to play a video clip.

## How to Use

When placing an object with the VKC Node Video Trigger attached (with Autoplay disabled), the thumbnail with a play button icon will be displayed.

This thumbnail material with a play button can be generated using the later mentioned Thumbnail Tool.

Selecting the object will begin playing the video.

Selecting the object during the video playing will stop the video and return to displaying the thumbnail. This function is same even when Autoplay is enabled.

| Thumbnail Texture | | Designate a image for video thumbnail. |
| PlayButton Texture | playbutton.png | Designate a playbutton icon to be on the thumbnail image.  |

## About Video Materials

The Shader of the material needs to be Unlit/Texture.

## About VideoPathMode

ClipMode refers to data inside the project.<br>
StringMode refers to the specified URL. It can be used for video streaming, etc.

!!! note caution
    StringMode is currently able only for internal developers.<br>
    For playing videos, please use the ClipMode.

## Notes

- Please Make sure to include this object under an object with [VKC Item Field](VKCItemField.md), as this object will not be displayed unless included into another Item. </br>

- Vket Cloud SDK enables only a single video to be played at a time.<br>To make a pseudo-display of multiple videos, split the display within one video to two, and designate the display range within the screen's material.

- If you don't set autoplay, you need to control the start of playback by some means, such as an action.<br>The below image uses [VKC Attribute Action Trigger](VKCAttributeActionTrigger.md) to implement video playback on click.

![HEOVideoTrigger_3](img/HEOVideoTrigger_3.jpg)

!!! note caution
    The SDK does not support distance falloff for video audio.<br>
    As an alternative implementation, the [VKC Item Area Collider](../VKCComponents/VKCItemAreaCollider.md) and [StopVideo Action](../Actions/Others/StopVideo.md) can be used to stop the video when the player goes out from a certain range.

!!! caution "VKC Node Video Trigger in Activity"
    On SDK Ver12.3.4 and later versions, VKC Node Video Trigger can be included on exporting Activity using [VKC Activity Exporter](../SDKTools/VKCActivityExporter.md).<br>
    However, as Autoplay cannot be enabled in Activity, the player must manually click or use the [VKC Item Area Collider](../VKCComponents/VKCItemAreaCollider.md) to play the video.
