# VKC/HEO Components Overview

The Vket Cloud SDK includes the following types of components:

- **Setting Component**: Components that can only be assigned one value per scene.
- **Item Component**: Components that can be assigned multiple values within a scene.
- **Node Component**: Components related to nodes.
- **Attribute Component**: Components that assign attributes to items, nodes, objects, etc.
- **Legacy Component (Deprecated)**: Components from older versions.

## Item Components

In Vket Cloud worlds, each element such as models, colliders, sound, and particles are internally categorized as "items".<br>
Defining a new item on the world scene can be done by adding a component to a game object, using such as VKC Item Field, VKC Item Object, etc.

Items are further categorized by "type", which defines the role of each item.<br>
here are a few examples:

- field: an item which cannot be moved from its initial position
- object: an item that can move, animate, and other dynamic actions
- plane: item for displaying an image
- textplane: item for displaying a text
- camera: item for switching to a new camera from the ordinary camera, mainly for special effects
- bg, se, system (component named as Audio): item for playing sound effects
- particle: item for emitting particles

| Field        | HEO Field                 | VKC Item Field             |
| Object       | HEO Object                | VKC Item Object            |
| Plane        | HEO Plane                 | VKC Item Plane             |
| Text Plane   | HEO Text Plane            | VKC Item Text Plane         |
| Audio        | HEO Audio                 | VKC Item Audio             |
| Particle     | HEO Particle              | VKC Item Particle          |

### About Item - Field

The "field" type item is unique for its immutability in the scene, which its position cannot be moved. Even if a script calls a field item to move it, it cannot be moved by feature.<br>
However, field items are useful for node controls and editing on Unity.<br>
Immutable objects such as background assets/props are recommended to be placed as a "field" item.<br>

Follow the instructions below to place an object as a "field" item:

1. Attach a [VKC Item Field](VKCItemField.md) component to a game object in the Unity scene

2. Place 3D models, colliders, etc. under the object with the [VKC Item Field](VKCItemField.md) component

This process will pack the Field object and its child objects to a single heo file on build, and place it on the scene as a field type item.<br>
The child objects will be referred as Nodes, which is explained later on.

### About Item - Object

As another type to place 3D models, "object" type items are used aside from field item.<br>
Object type items are able to change position, rotation, and scale by script unlike field item, and can play animations including bone animations.<br>
However, as outputting the item requires a rather complex procedure, field item is a viable option if the object needs several readjustments.<br>
For dynamic objects or scriptable objects, "object" type would be the recommended item.

Follow the instructions below to place an object as a "object" item:

1. Select a game object to designate as an "object" item (multiple selections are not allowed)

2. Run Vket Cloud SDK > [Export Field](../WorldMakingGuide/HEOExporter_Tutorial.md)

3. Save heo file at a designated location

4. Place a game object in the scene and attach [VKC Item Object](../VKCComponents/VKCItemObject.md) component

5. Allocate the saved heo file to [VKC Item Object](../VKCComponents/VKCItemObject.md)

This procedure will copy the heo file at the designated location on build, and register it as an object type item.

*Note: Objects following an Avatar bone is also referred to as "Object".
When configuring [Show/HideObject](../Actions/Object/ShowHideObject.md) in [Action Trigger](VKCAttributeActionTrigger.md), the "Object" referred here is Avatar-following objects!

## Node Components

In Vket Cloud, the previously mentioned Field and Object are formatted in a unique .heo 3D model file format.<br>
.heo has a unique feature, which child objects in Unity will be considered as **Nodes** in .heo, and will be a target for Node-related components and HeliScript methods.

As an important note, nodes in .heo objects **do not have a Hierarchy**<br>
Even if the original object had a hierarchy defined on Unity, this will be dismantled on exporting as a heo file.<br>
For instance, if a Node which was a parent object on Unity is designated for show/hide, the former-child object nodes will not be affected by show/hide on Vket Cloud, as the hierarchy does not exist.
