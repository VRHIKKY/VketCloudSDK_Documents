# Not Reflected During Build

![NotReflectedDuringBuild00](img/NotReflectedDuringBuild.jpg)

Starting from SDK 5.X, the "EditorOnly" tag is now applied during the build process.  
In projects that have existed since the SDK 4 era, if the "EditorOnly" tag is set,  
it will no longer be reflected after updating the SDK. Please be mindful of tag settings.
