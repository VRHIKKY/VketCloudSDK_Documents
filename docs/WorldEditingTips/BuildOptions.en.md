# Build Options

In build settings, creators can perform various operations on the files that make up the world during the Build and Run process. There are two ways to change the build settings:

1. You can toggle the simple settings on or off by navigating to **Vket Cloud SDK > Build Option**.

## Build Option Settings

## Texture Override Settings

| Label | Initial Value | Function |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Convert texture size to Max size at build time | false | Convert texture size depending on the Maxsize designated on the texture's Inspector.<br> This function has been revised on Ver13.4, which reduced the build time and world load time when this configuration is enabled. |

The texture's MaxSize(convert size on build) can be designated in the Inspector.<br>
This designates how much the texture will be compressed.<br>
For example, by setting MaxSize to 64 and enabling "Convert texture size to Max size at build time," the total world load time is expected to be reduced.
